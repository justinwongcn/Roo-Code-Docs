# Roo Code 3.23.18 Release Notes (2025-01-24)

This release fixes critical command parsing issues and improves error handling with better UI resilience.

## Bug Fixes

* **Command Parsing**: Fixed crashes when running complex bash commands with special syntax like BASH_REMATCH arrays. Users can now create and use GitHub CLI aliases with advanced bash features (thanks daniel-lxs, KJ7LNW!) ([#5743](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5743))
* **Error Handling**: Added ErrorBoundary component that prevents the entire UI from crashing. Instead of showing a blank screen, errors now display helpful messages with stack traces (thanks KJ7LNW, elianiva, wolverin0!) ([#5085](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5085))
* **Todo List**: Fixed the todo list toggle feature so users can properly enable or disable automatic todo list tracking in their tasks (thanks chrarnoldus!) ([#6103](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6103))

## Misc Improvements

* **Command Timeouts**: Improved reliability when terminating unresponsive commands - processes that timeout are now forcefully terminated with SIGKILL, preventing hanging operations ([#6071](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6071))
