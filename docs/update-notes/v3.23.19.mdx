# Roo Code 3.23.19 Release Notes (2025-01-24)

This release introduces Roo Code Cloud waitlist access and improves command handling with smarter validation.

## Roo Code Cloud Waitlist

We're excited to announce early access to Roo Code Cloud! You can now join the waitlist directly from Roo Code (thanks brunobergher!) ([#6104](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6104)):

- **Easy Discovery**: Prominent call-to-action buttons appear in the website header and extension interface (for users with 3+ tasks).
- **Quick Signup**: Join the waitlist with just a click to get early access to cloud features.
- **Seamless Integration**: The waitlist CTAs are thoughtfully placed to be helpful without being intrusive.

Get ready for the future of cloud-powered AI coding assistance!

## QOL Improvements

* **Command Parsing**: Multi-line commands are now properly parsed as separate commands, making it easier to work with scripts or multi-step command sequences ([#6121](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6121))
* **Smarter Auto-Deny**: Commands with subshells are now more intelligently validated - they're only auto-denied if they contain denied prefixes, reducing false denials and making command execution more flexible ([#6123](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/6123))
