# Roo Code 3.23.16 Release Notes (2025-07-19)

This release adds new modes, improves UI elements, enhances performance, and fixes several bugs.

## New Modes and Mode Enhancements

We've added powerful new modes and enhanced existing ones (thanks hannesrudolph!) ([#5913](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5913)):

- **Issue Investigator Mode**: A new mode specifically designed for investigating and analyzing GitHub issues.
- **Enhanced Issue Writer Mode**: Improved capabilities for creating and managing issues.
- **Better Mode Discovery**: Custom modes now support description and whenToUse fields for better discoverability (thanks RandalSchwartz!) ([#5862](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5862)).

These improvements make it easier to work with GitHub issues and understand when to use each mode.

## Message Management Overhaul

The message editing and deletion system has been completely redesigned (thanks liwilliam2021!) ([#5538](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5538)):

This makes managing your conversation history more reliable and user-friendly.
