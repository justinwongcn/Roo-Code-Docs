# Roo Code 3.23 Release Notes

This release graduates codebase indexing to a stable feature, introduces a powerful new todo list for managing complex tasks, and includes critical performance improvements and bug fixes!

## Codebase Indexing: Always On, Always Ready

Codebase indexing has graduated from an experimental feature and is now a core part of Roo Code, available directly from your chat input. Once configured, the indexer runs automatically in the background, ensuring Roo always has an up-to-date semantic understanding of your project. To get started FREE, see the [Codebase Indexing quick start guide](/features/codebase-indexing#quick-start-guide).

([#5378](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5378), [#5377](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5377), [#5383](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5383), [#5483](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5483), [#5481](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5481), [#5228](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5228), [#5214](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5214), [#5158](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5158), [#5402](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5402), [#5451](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5451), [#5352](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5352), [#5403](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5403), [#5785](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5785))

## New: Task Todo List

This release introduces a new todo list feature to help you keep track of complex tasks. Roo Code will now display a checklist of steps for your task, ensuring that no step is missed. You can view and manage the todo list directly in the chat interface.

Thank you to qdaxb for this feature! ([#5182](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5182), [#5472](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5472), [#5473](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5473), [#5482](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5482))

## New: Command Denylist

We've added the ability to automatically reject unwanted commands in your workflows:

- **Always Reject**: Mark commands as "always reject" to prevent accidental execution
- **Time Saving**: No need to manually reject the same commands repeatedly
- **Workflow Control**: Complements existing auto-approval functionality with "always reject" option

This gives you better control over command execution in automated workflows.

## Windows Support for Claude Code

We've added native Windows support for the Claude Code provider (thanks SannidhyaSah, kwk9892!) ([#5615](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5615)):

- **Fixed Windows Compatibility**: Claude Code provider no longer gets stuck on Windows systems
- **Improved Input Handling**: Uses stdin-based input to eliminate command-line length limitations
- **Cross-Platform**: Works reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux

## QOL Improvements

- **Simplified Prompt History**: Navigate your prompt history using only the up and down arrow keys when the cursor is at the start of the input field ([#5467](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5467))
- **API Provider Search**: You can now search and filter the list of API providers in the settings (thanks GOODBOY008!) ([#5278](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/5278))
